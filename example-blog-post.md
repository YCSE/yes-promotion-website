## What You're About to Learn

Sarah stared at her laptop screen, frustrated. Three years of English classes, countless textbooks, and she still felt tongue-tied during her video calls with international colleagues. Sound familiar?

"I wish I could just move to London for a year," she sighed to her friend Maya over coffee.

"What if I told you," Maya replied with a knowing smile, "that my cousin became fluent in English without ever leaving Seoul? She created her own English world right in her apartment."

That conversation changed everything for Sarah. And today, it's going to change everything for you too.

Welcome to your **English Immersion Manual** – your step-by-step guide to transforming any space into an English-learning paradise, complete with troubleshooting solutions for every obstacle you'll encounter.

## Manual Overview: What English Immersion Actually Means

Before we dive into the technical specifications, let's clarify what we're building here.

**DIY Immersion**: Strategically designing your environment and daily routines to maximize English exposure and practice, creating the same learning conditions without the plane ticket.
